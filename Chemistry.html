    <h1><a href="Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a></h1>
<p>Chemistry is the science that studies the composition, structure and properties of matter, as well as the changes that it experiences during chemical reactions and its relationship with energy. Linus Pauling defines it as the science that studies substances, their structure (types and forms of arrangement of atoms), their properties and the reactions that transform them into other substances in reference to time. Chemistry deals mainly with supratomic groupings, such as gases, molecules, crystals and metals, studying their composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions. Chemistry also includes understanding the properties and interactions of matter on the atomic scale.</p>

<p>Most chemical processes can be studied directly in the laboratory, using a number of often well-established techniques, both in material handling and in understanding the underlying processes. An alternative approach is that provided by molecular modeling techniques, which draw conclusions from computational models. Chemistry is often called "central science" because of its connecting role with the other natural sciences.</p>

<p>Modern chemistry developed from alchemy, an esoteric but also experimental proto-scientific practice, which combined elements of chemistry, metallurgy, physics, medicine, biology, among other sciences and arts. This phase ends with the chemical revolution, with the discovery of gases by Robert Boyle, the law of conservation of matter and the theory of combustion by oxygen postulated by the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier. The systematization became patent with the creation of the periodic table of the elements and the introduction of atomic theory, when researchers developed a fundamental understanding of the states of matter, ions, chemical bonds, and chemical reactions. Since the first half of the 19th century, the development of chemistry has been accompanied by the appearance and expansion of a chemical industry of great relevance in today's economy and quality of life.</p>

<p>The disciplines of chemistry are grouped according to the kind of subject under study or the type of study carried out. Among these are inorganic chemistry, which studies inorganic matter; organic chemistry, which studies organic matter; biochemistry, which studies the substances existing in biological organisms; physicochemistry, which includes the structural and energetic aspects of chemical systems at macroscopic, molecular and atomic scales, and analytical chemistry, which analyzes samples of matter and tries to understand their composition and structure through various studies and reactions.</p>
