    <h1><a href="Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a></h1>
<p><strong>Mathematics </strong>(from
 Greek: &mu;&#940;&theta;&eta;&mu;&alpha;, m&aacute;th&#275;ma, 'knowledge, study, learning') includes the 
study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), 
space (geometry), and change (mathematical analysis). It has no 
generally accepted definition.</p>

<p>Mathematicians
 seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the 
truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical 
structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can
 be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use
 of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, 
calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and 
motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human 
activity from as far back as written records exist. The research 
required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries
 of sustained inquiry.</p>

<p>Rigorous 
arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's 
Elements. Since the pioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932), David
 Hilbert (1862-1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late 19th 
century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as 
establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen 
axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace 
until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with 
new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of 
mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.</p>

<p>Mathematics 
is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, 
medicine, finance, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics has led 
to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game 
theory. Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its 
own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical 
applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered 
later.</p>

<h2>Definitions of mathematics</h2>

<p>Mathematics 
has no generally accepted definition. Aristotle defined mathematics as 
"the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until the 18th 
century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not
 distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, 
abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" 
from real instances set mathematics apart.</p>

<p>In the 19th 
century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to 
address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry, 
which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, 
mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new 
definitions.</p>

<p>A great many
 professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of 
mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on 
whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, "Mathematics 
is what mathematicians do."</p>

<h2>Mathematics as science</h2>

<p>The German 
mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen
 of the Sciences". More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called 
mathematics "the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind 
scientific discovery". The philosopher Karl Popper observed that "most 
mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, 
hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much 
closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it
 seemed even recently." Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a
 system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested
 by experience."</p>

<p>Several authors consider that mathematics is not a science because it does not rely on empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Mathematics 
shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably
 the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition 
and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures 
in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics 
continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and 
simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and 
mathematics.</p>

<p>The opinions
 of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians[57] 
feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of 
its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal 
arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to 
turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and 
its applications in science and engineering has driven much development 
in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the
 philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) 
or discovered (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically
 grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer 
levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of 
mathematics.</p>
