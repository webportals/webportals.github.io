    <h1><a href="Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a></h1>
<p>Mathematics (or mathematics) is a set of abstract knowledge resulting from logical reasoning applied to various objects such as mathematical sets, numbers, shapes, structures, transformations, etc. ; as well as the mathematical relationships and operations that exist between these objects. They are also the field of research developing this knowledge, as well as the discipline that teaches it.</p>

<p>They have several branches such as: arithmetic, algebra, analysis, geometry, mathematical logic, etc. There is also a certain separation between pure mathematics and applied mathematics.</p>

<p>Mathematics is distinguished from other sciences by a particular relation to the real because the observation and the experiment do not relate to physical objects; mathematics is not an empirical science. They are entirely intellectual in nature, based on axioms declared to be true or on postulates provisionally accepted. These axioms constitute its foundations and therefore do not depend on any other proposition. A mathematical statement - generally called, after being validated, a theorem, proposition, lemma, fact, scholia or corollary - is considered valid when the formal discourse which establishes its truth respects a certain rational structure called demonstration, or logico-deductive reasoning. A statement which has not yet been demonstrated but which is nevertheless considered plausible is called a conjecture.</p>

<p>Although mathematical results are purely formal truths, they nevertheless find applications in other sciences and in various fields of technology. This is how Eugene Wigner speaks of "the unreasonable efficiency of mathematics in the natural sciences".</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Areas</h2>

<p>Divisions of mathematics into two, three or four different fields are proposed: algebra and analysis, or algebra, analysis and geometry, or algebra, analysis, geometry and probability. Such divisions are not obvious and the borders separating them are always poorly defined. Indeed, many results call for a variety of mathematical skills. The Fermat-Wiles theorem, established in 1994, is an example. Although the statement is formulated in a so-called arithmetic way, the proof requires deep skills in analysis and geometry.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Core areas</h2>

<p>Algebra is the set of mathematical methods aimed at studying and developing algebraic structures and at understanding the relationships they maintain between them. Algebra, in the current sense, historically finds its origins in the understanding of polynomial equations and in the development of methods of resolution: research in these fields has given rise to the emergence of the notions that found the theory of groups, the theory of Galois. or even algebraic geometry.</p>

<p>In a very restrictive sense, analysis is the part of mathematics interested in questions of the regularity of the applications of a real or complex variable: one then speaks more readily of real analysis or complex analysis. In a broad sense, it encompasses all related mathematical methods, and a number of methods for understanding and analyzing function spaces.</p>

<p>Geometry tries to understand first of all objects in space, then by extension is interested in the properties of more abstract objects, with several dimensions, introduced according to several approaches, relating as much to analysis as to algebra.</p>

<p>The probabilities try to formalize everything that is random. Although old, they have experienced a revival with the theory of measurement. Understanding the random laws that best reflect the data already produced forms statistics.</p>
