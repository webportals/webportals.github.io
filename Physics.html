    <h1><a href="Physics.html">Physics</a></h1>
<p>Physics is the science that tries to understand, model and explain the natural phenomena of the universe. It corresponds to the study of the world around us in all its forms, of the laws of its variation and its evolution.</p>

<p>Physics develops experimentally verifiable representations of the world in a given domain of definition. It produces several readings of the world, each of which is only considered accurate up to a point. Modeling of physical systems may or may not include chemical and biological processes.</p>

<p>Physics as conceptualized by Isaac Newton, today called classical physics, stumbled upon the explanation of natural phenomena such as the radiation of the black body (ultraviolet catastrophe) or the anomalies of the orbit of the planet Mercury, which posed a real problem for physicists. The attempts made to understand and model the new phenomena which were accessed at the end of the 19th century profoundly revised the Newtonian model to give rise to two new sets of physical theories. Some would say that there are therefore three sets of established physical theories, each valid in its own field of applications:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classical physics (world of solid, liquid and gaseous media), still relevant today, it is this which applies, for example, to the construction of roads, bridges and airplanes. It uses the old notions of time, space, matter and energy as defined by Newton;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quantum physics (the microscopic world of particles and fields) which applies, for example, to the technology used for the production of electronic components (the tunneling diode for example) or to lasers. It is based on new definitions of energy and matter but retains the old notions of time and space of classical physics, the latter two being contradicted by general relativity. Quantum physics has never been at fault to date;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General relativity (the macroscopic world of planets, black holes and gravity) which applies, for example, to the development and processing of information necessary for the operation of GPS systems. It is based on new definitions of time and space but retains the old notions of energy and matter of classical physics, the latter two being contradicted by quantum physics. General relativity has never been faulted to date.</p>

<p>Others believe that each branch of physics has its own importance, without necessarily being included in one of these sets. Moreover, it turns out that there is no common physical situation where these last two theories apply at the same time. Relativity applies to the macroscopic world and quantum physics to the microscopic world. The current problem in fundamental physics research is therefore to try to unify these last two theories (see Quantum gravity).</p>

<p>The old divisions in force at the end of the 19th century: mechanical, caloric, acoustic, optical, electricity, magnetism are completed or replaced by:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the size of the structural elements at the center of the modeling: elementary particles, atomic nuclei, atoms, molecules, macromolecules or polymers, grains of matter, etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the characteristics of the interactions at the origin of the phases or states of matter: plasma, supercritical fluid, gas, liquid, solid.</p>

<p>Classical physics is based on theories prior to relativity and quanta. It applies when:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either the speed is much lower than the speed of light in a vacuum;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the discontinuity of energy levels is impossible to demonstrate.</p>

<p>Physics was born with the repeated experiments of Galileo who accepts, beyond the principles and conventions resulting from mathematical schemes, only results which are measurable and reproducible by experience. The method chosen makes it possible to confirm or refute the hypotheses based on a given theory. It quantitatively describes and models the fundamental beings present in the universe, seeks to describe the movement by the forces which are exerted there and their effects. She develops theories using the tool of mathematics to describe and predict the evolution of systems.</p>
