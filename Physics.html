    <h1><a href="Physics.html">Physics</a></h1>
<p><strong>Physics </strong>(from
 Ancient Greek: &phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#942; (&#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta;), romanized: physik&#7703; (epist&#7703;m&#275;), lit. 
'knowledge of nature', from &phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; ph&yacute;sis 'nature') is the natural 
science that studies matter, its motion and behavior through space and 
time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of 
the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to 
understand how the universe behaves.</p>

<p>Physics is 
one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of 
astronomy, perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, 
physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics were a 
part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 
17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors
 in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary 
areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the 
boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics 
often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and 
suggest new avenues of research in academic disciplines such as 
mathematics and philosophy.</p>

<p>Advances in 
physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances
 in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and 
nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that 
have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, 
computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in 
thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances
 in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.</p>

<h2>Classical physics</h2>

<p>Physics 
became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental 
and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the 
laws of physics.</p>

<p>Major 
developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric 
model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the 
laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by Johannes 
Kepler between 1609 and 1619, pioneering work on telescopes and 
observational astronomy by Galileo Galilei in the 16th and 17th 
Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of 
motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name. 
Newton also developed calculus, the mathematical study of change, which 
provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems.</p>

<p>The 
discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics
 resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial Revolution
 as energy needs increased. The laws comprising classical physics remain
 very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at 
non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation 
in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the 
theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such 
scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small 
objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern 
physics in the 20th century.</p>

<h2>Modern physics</h2>

<p>Modern 
physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in 
quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Both of these
 theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in 
certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of 
light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by 
Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected 
by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical 
mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of 
light. Black-body radiation provided another problem for classical 
physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of
 material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to
 their frequency; this, along with the photoelectric effect and a 
complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, 
led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical 
physics at very small scales.</p>

<p>Quantum 
mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin 
Schr&ouml;dinger and Paul Dirac. From this early work, and work in related 
fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived. Following 
the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs 
boson at CERN in 2012, all fundamental particles predicted by the 
standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physics beyond 
the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active 
area of research. Areas of mathematics in general are important to this 
field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.</p>
