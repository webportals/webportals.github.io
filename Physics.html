<p>Physics (from the Latin physica, and this from the ancient Greek φυσικός, "natural, relative to nature") is the natural science that studies the fundamental components of the Universe, energy, matter, space-time and fundamental interactions. Physics is a basic science closely linked with mathematics and logic in the formulation and quantification of its principles.</p>

<p>The scope of physics is extraordinarily broad and can include studies as diverse as quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, or optics. Modern physics is geared towards increasing specialization, where researchers tend to focus on particular areas rather than being universalistic. , as were Albert Einstein or Lev Landau, who worked in a multiplicity of areas.</p>

<p>Physics is perhaps the oldest of all academic disciplines, as astronomy is one of its sub-disciplines. It also began more than two thousand years ago with the first works of Greek philosophers. In the past two millennia, physics was considered part of what we now call philosophy, chemistry, and certain branches of mathematics and biology, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century it became a modern science, unique in its own right. However, in some spheres such as mathematical physics and quantum chemistry, the limits of physics with other branches of science remain difficult to distinguish. The formulation of theories about the laws that govern the Universe has been a central objective of physics since ancient times, with the philosophy of the systematic use of quantitative observation and testing experiments as a source of verification. The key to the historical development of physics includes milestones such as the law of universal gravitation and classical Newtonian mechanics, the understanding of the nature of electricity and its relationship to Faraday's magnetism, the theory of special relativity and theory of Einstein's general relativity, the development of thermodynamics with James Prescott Joule and Sadi Carnot, and the model of quantum mechanics at the levels of atomic and subatomic physics with Louis-Victor de Broglie, Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger.</p>

<p>This discipline encourages skills, methods and a scientific culture that allow us to understand our physical and living world, and then act on it. Their cognitive processes have become protagonists of general scientific and technological knowledge and doing, helping to know, theorize, experiment and evaluate acts within various systems, clarifying cause and effect in numerous phenomena. In this way, physics contributes to the conservation and preservation of resources, facilitating awareness and effective and sustained participation of society in solving its own problems.</p>

<p>Physics is significant and influential, not only because advances in understanding have often translated into new technologies, but also because new ideas in physics resonate with the other sciences, mathematics, and philosophy.</p>

<p>Physics is not just a theoretical science; it is also an experimental science. Like all science, it seeks that its conclusions can be verifiable through experiments and that the theory can make predictions of future experiments based on previous observations. Given the breadth of the field of study of physics, as well as its historical development in relation to other sciences, it can be considered the fundamental or central science, since it includes within its field of study chemistry, biology and electronics , in addition to explaining its phenomena.</p>

<p>Physics, in its attempt to describe natural phenomena with accuracy and truthfulness, has reached unthinkable limits: current knowledge ranges from the description of microscopic fundamental particles to the birth of stars in the universe and even the power to know with great probability what happened in the first moments of the birth of our universe, to name a few fields.</p>
