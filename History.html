    <h1><a href="History.html">History</a></h1>
<p>History, often written with the first letter capital, is both the study and the writing of past facts and events regardless of their variety and complexity. History is also a human and social science. The past itself is also commonly referred to as history (synecdoche), as in the lessons of history. History is a written account by which men and women (historians) strive to make known bygone times. These attempts are never entirely independent of foreign-domain conditionings such as their author's worldview or culture, but they are meant to be developed from sources rather than guided by speculation or ideology.</p>

<p>Over the centuries, historians have shaped their methods and fields of intervention, while reassessing their sources, origin and exploitation. The academic discipline of study and writing of history, including the critique of methods, is historiography. It is based on various auxiliary sciences supplementing, depending on the work carried out, the general competence of the historian. Despite everything, it remains a human construction, inevitably part of its time, capable of being used outside its domain, in particular for political purposes.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Historiography</h2>

<p>Historiography (1550), literally “writing history”, is a name derived from the “historiographer”, that is, “the one who writes history”. The name originally designated a collection of historical works. By extension, historiography has designated the history of the writing of history. Established as a specialty of the historical discipline, historiography (German Geschichtswissenschaft or Geschichtsschreibung, English historical writing) generally presents the perspective of a historian on his predecessors and their work.</p>

<p>Several coherent sets of historical works - or “historiographies” - exist for the same period, generally offering different points of view on history. Until the second half of the 20th century, a “historiography” often took on a “national” character, insofar as it reported a political point of view on events. For example, it is possible to cite for the Middle Ages Byzantine historiography and Frankish historiography: these present very differently the problem of the quarrel of the Images which for a time opposed the Roman Church and the Byzantine Church to the era of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Historiography deals with the same problems as methodology, but the approach to these questions is necessarily different: the object of the methodology is the study of the work that the historian performs upstream to write history, while historiography is attached to the finished work of historians. Also, historiography often has a more controversial character. Finally, the conclusions of historiographical studies are generally at the origin of methodological changes.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Fields and periodization</h2>

<p>According to the times and the role that history has played over the centuries, the historian's fields of study have fundamentally evolved. Thus, "civilization" (taken in the narrow sense, that is to say the government and religious practices of a population) and war have long been the main objects of this historical reflection which presented itself as "memory. of humanity ”. The objects of history are therefore initially centered on military history, political history and religious history. History is gradually seeing its field widen towards diplomatic history, social history, cultural history and even economic history. At the turn of the 21st century, she focused on the one hand towards unique objects, distinct realities, in an individualizing approach, and on the other hand towards the correlation between historical phenomena and environmental phenomena such as climate change, earthquakes or major volcanic eruptions and their consequences.</p>
