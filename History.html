    <h1><a href="History.html">History</a></h1>
<p>History is the science that aims to study events in the past, traditionally of humanity, and as a method, that of the social / human sciences, as well as that of the natural sciences in an interdisciplinary framework.1 It is the discipline that studies and chronologically narrates past events. It is also called "history" to the period that elapses from the appearance of writing to the present, although it is a widely surpassed convention, and prehistory is also considered an intrinsic part of history.</p>

<p>Beyond the meanings of historical science, history science, historical science or history science, "history", in the usual language, is the narration of any event, even imaginary events and lies; be its purpose deception, aesthetic pleasure or any other (historical fiction). On the contrary, the purpose of historical science is to find out the facts and processes that occurred and developed in the past and interpret them according to criteria of the greatest possible objectivity; although the possibility of fulfilling such purposes and the degree to which they are possible are in themselves objects of study of historiology or theory of history, such as epistemology or scientific knowledge of history. </p>

<p>In turn, the past itself is called "history," and one can even speak of a "natural history" in which humanity was not present (a classic term now in disuse, used in opposition to social history, to refer not to not only to geology and paleontology, but also to many other natural sciences - the boundaries between the field to which this term traditionally refers and that of prehistory and archeology are imprecise, through palaeoanthropology - and it is claimed complement with environmental or ecohistorian history, and be updated with the so-called «Big History»: an interdisciplinary academic field that is defined as "the attempt to understand in a unified way, the history of the Cosmos or Universe, the Earth, life and humanity ", covering the events that occurred from the Big Bang to the history of the present world).</p>

<p>This use of the term "history" makes it equivalent to "change in time". In that sense, it is opposed to the concept of philosophical equivalent to essence or permanence (which allows us to speak of a natural philosophy in classical texts and today, especially in Anglo-Saxon academic circles, as equivalent to physics). For any field of knowledge, you can have a historical perspective - change - or a philosophical perspective - its essence. In fact, this can be done for history itself (see historical time with) and for time itself (see Stephen Hawking's History of Time, popular book on cosmology). In this sense, all past in relation to the present refers to time and its chronology, and therefore to have history. </p>

<p>In the health sciences, the concept of medical history is used to record significant health data of a patient, dating back to the birth of her or even doing the same with regard to her genetic inheritance. </p>

<p>The person in charge of studying history is called a historian or historian. The professional historian is conceived of as the specialist in the academic discipline of history, and the non-professional historian is often referred to as a chronicler.</p>
