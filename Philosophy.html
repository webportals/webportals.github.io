<p>Philosophy (from ancient Greek φιλοσοφία 'love of wisdom' derived from φιλεῖν [fileîn] 'to love' and σοφία [sofía] 'wisdom'; 1 trans. In Latin as philosophĭa) is the study of a variety of fundamental problems about of questions such as existence, knowledge, truth, morality, beauty, mind and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras.</p>

<p>In addressing these problems, philosophy distinguishes itself from mysticism, esotericism, mythology, and religion by its emphasis on rational arguments over arguments from authority, and from science because it generally conducts its research in a non-empirical manner, be it through conceptual analysis, thought experiments, speculation or other a priori methods, although without ignoring the importance of empirical data. Historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge, and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. From the time of the Greek philosopher Aristotle until the 19th century, "natural philosophy" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, the work Mathematical principles of natural philosophy by Isaac Newton (1687).</p>

<p>Western philosophy has been profoundly influential and profoundly influenced by Western science, religion, and politics.Many important philosophers were great scientists, theologians, or politicians at the same time, and some fundamental notions of these disciplines still remain. philosophical object of study. This overlap between disciplines is due to the fact that philosophy is a very broad discipline. In the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. Since then, various areas of research that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, linguistics and economics.</p>

<p>Today, the major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which deals with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and beliefs; ethics, which deals with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow conclusions to be drawn from true premises.Other notable subfields include philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.</p>
