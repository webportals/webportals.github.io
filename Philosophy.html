    <h1><a href="Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a></h1>
<p>Philosophy, from the ancient Greek φιλοσοφία (composed of φιλεῖν, philein: "to love"; and of σοφία, sophia: "wisdom" or "to know"), literally meaning "love of wisdom", is an approach of critical reflection and of questioning about the world, knowledge and human existence. It has existed since Antiquity in the West and the East, through the figure of the philosopher, not only as a rational activity but also as a way of life. The history of philosophy allows us to understand its evolution.</p>

<p>Anchored from its origins in the debate of ideas shared during dialogue, philosophy can be seen as an activity of creation, meditation, definition and analysis of concepts such as good, evil, beauty, justice. . It can also be seen as a quest for truth, freedom, meaning, consciousness, in short, a quest for happiness.</p>

<p>In Aristotle, wisdom is the science of first principles and first causes. It is a definition on which Aristotelians in medieval times used to found the first philosophy.</p>

<p>In the modern sense and for some contemporary philosophers, philosophy is not knowledge, nor a body of knowledge, but a process of reflection on the knowledge available. It has become a discipline of the human sciences.</p>

<p>The field of study of philosophy can embrace a set of disciplines such as the human and social sciences, the formal sciences and the natural sciences, to which it is historically linked.</p>

<p>Philosophy spawned fundamental fields of study such as theory of knowledge, political philosophy, metaphysics, ethics, and logic. Over time, these branches of philosophy have seen the birth of ramifications such as those of ontology, aesthetics, the philosophy of law, epistemology (philosophy of science), philosophy of mind, anthropology philosophical, or the philosophy of language, among others.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Definition</h2>

<p>Contemporary Western philosophy, which stems from a multiple tradition, comes in various forms: hermeneutical and post-Kantian tradition in Germany, analytical philosophy in English-speaking countries and in much of Europe, phenomenological tradition in continental Europe28. Some strongly question the philosophical tradition and its presuppositions such as feminist philosophy, the deconstruction of Derrida or Heidegger. These currents form as many different practices and divergent opinions on the nature of philosophy, which prohibit giving a single definition acceptable to all. If there are several philosophical traditions today, none can claim to summarize philosophical activity on its own, nor to describe philosophical activity in a consensual manner.</p>

<p>The difficulties in defining philosophy are also epistemological in nature, because it is difficult to rigorously delimit the methods, themes and objects of philosophy. Historically, it has been able to draw inspiration from other disciplines (mathematics, even positive sciences). However, she never succeeded in developing a method or a set of methods that would have succeeded in establishing itself among philosophers (as the experimental method has imposed itself in physics and chemistry for example). In addition, the amalgamations between philosophy and other disciplines are further favored by a tradition of philosophers with very diverse interests. Thus Aristotle will have been a logician as well as a philosopher or a naturalist. Determining the philosopher by his social function is therefore not easy. Most of the activities formerly belonging to the discipline have now become autonomous (psychology, natural sciences, etc.), and the proper part of philosophy has been reduced.</p>

<p>But it is also difficult to determine the essence of Western philosophy, either because its status in society is itself difficult to pin down, or because it has been reduced to other apparently close disciplines. From Antiquity, for example, Socrates was confused in The Clouds of Aristophanes with the Sophists, whom Plato nevertheless presents to us as his adversaries in his dialogues.</p>

<p>Immanuel Kant reduced the domain of philosophy to four questions: “What can I know? What should I do ? What can I hope for? What is the man? "</p>
