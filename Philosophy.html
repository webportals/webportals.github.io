    <h1><a href="Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a></h1>
<p><strong>Philosophy </strong>(from
 Greek: &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha;, philosophia, 'love of wisdom') is the study of 
general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, 
reason, mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems 
to be studied or resolved. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras 
(c. 570 - 495 BCE). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical 
discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.</p>

<p>Classic 
philosophical questions include: "Is it possible to know anything?", and
 if so, "Can we prove it?" Philosophers also pose more practical and 
concrete questions such as: "Is there a best way to live?", "Is it 
better to be just, even if one could get away with being unjust?", 'do 
humans have free will?'</p>

<p>Historically,
 philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge. From the time of 
Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the 19th century, "natural 
philosophy" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. For example, 
Newton's 1687 Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became
 classified as a book of physics.</p>

<p>In the 19th 
century, the growth of modern research universities led academic 
philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. In 
the modern era, some investigations that were traditionally part of 
philosophy became separate academic disciplines, including psychology, 
sociology, linguistics, and economics. Other investigations closely 
related to art, science, politics, or other pursuits remained part of 
philosophy. For example, is beauty objective or subjective? Are there 
many scientific methods or just one? Is political utopia a hopeful dream
 or hopeless fantasy?</p>

<p>Major 
subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned
 with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, 
which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is 
concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of 
inference that allow one to deduce conclusions from true premises. Other
 notable subfields include philosophy of science, political philosophy, 
aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.</p>

<h2>Knowledge</h2>

<p>Initially, 
the term 'philosophy' referred to any body of knowledge. In this sense, 
philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science,
 education, and politics. Though as of the 2000s it has been classified 
as a book of physics, Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural 
Philosophy (1687) uses the term natural philosophy as it was understood 
at the time to encompass disciplines, such as astronomy, medicine and 
physics, that later became associated with sciences.</p>

<p>In the first
 part of his Academica 1, Cicero introduced the division of philosophy 
into logic, physics, and ethics, emulating Epicurus' division of his 
doctrine into canon, physics, and ethics.</p>

<p>In section 
thirteen of his Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers 1, 
Diogenes La&euml;rtius (3rd century), the first historian of philosophy, 
established the traditional division of philosophical inquiry into three
 parts:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Natural philosophy (i.e. physics, from Greek: ta physika, lit. 'things 
having to do with physis [nature]') was the study of the constitution 
and processes of transformation in the physical world;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral philosophy (i.e. ethics, from &ecirc;thika, 'having 
to do with character, disposition, manners') was the study of goodness, 
right and wrong, justice and virtue; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metaphysical philosophy (i.e. logic, from logik&oacute;s, 
'of or pertaining to reason or speech') was the study of existence, 
causation, God, logic, forms, and other abstract objects (meta ta 
physika, 'after the Physics').</p>

<p>This 
division is not obsolete but has changed: natural philosophy has split 
into the various natural sciences, especially physics, astronomy, 
chemistry, biology, and cosmology; moral philosophy has birthed the 
social sciences, while still including value theory (e.g. ethics, 
aesthetics, political philosophy, etc.); and metaphysical philosophy has
 given way to formal sciences such as logic, mathematics and philosophy 
of science, while still including epistemology, cosmology, etc.</p>

<h2>Philosophical progress</h2>

<p>Many 
philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated 
today. McGinn (1993) and others claim that no philosophical progress has
 occurred during that interval. Chalmers (2013) and others, by contrast,
 see progress in philosophy similar to that in science, while Brewer 
(2011) argued that "progress" is the wrong standard by which to judge 
philosophical activity.</p>
