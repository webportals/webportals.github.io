    <h1><a href="index.html">Geography</a></h1>
<p>Geography (from ancient Greek γεωγραφία - geographia, composed of "η γη" (he gê) (the Earth) and "γραφειν" (graphein) describe ,, then from Latin geographia, literally translated as "drawing of the Earth" ) is a science (or family of sciences - see infra, subtitle Evolution -) centered on the present, having for object the description of the Earth and in particular the study of the physical, biological and human phenomena which occur on the terrestrial globe, at a certain level of relative abstraction which lends itself to it, multidisciplinarity understood or even transdisciplinarity in a certain sense. The Quebec government's geographic information portal defines geography as "a science of knowledge of the current, natural and human aspect of the earth's surface. It makes it possible to understand the spatial organization of phenomena (physical or human) which appear in our environment and shape our world ".</p>

<p>It is divided into three main branches:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mathematical geography which is the first to appear with “the study of the shapes and dimensions of the Earth”&nbsp; through geodesy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; physical geography which includes scientific disciplines integrating the natural sciences;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human geography which includes scientific disciplines integrating the social sciences.</p>

<p>Since, thanks to advances in astronomy and space travel, formations are now known elsewhere than on this planet, the term is used for all celestial objects.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">General geography</h2>

<p>Human geography is the spatial study of human activities on the surface of the globe, therefore the study of the ecumene, that is to say of the regions inhabited by man. The analysis of human geography was carried out at that time through the prism of densities: we sought to understand the preferences that guide men in the choice of the place where they were going to live. The university geography of the early twentieth century emphasizes the weight of history. In this approach, the interaction between humans and nature by means of their knowledge and their own history leads to distinguish societies and regions according to their type of life.</p>

<p>Human geography was at the beginning of the 20th century the poor relation of the discipline. Like physical geography, it was above all a very descriptive and not very analytical discipline. In the years 1920-1930, an economic approach to human geography developed around Albert Demangeon, close to the Annales school. But, it is still the regional geography which dominates during this period. In the 1960s, the new geography, or spatial analysis, developed, which had the ambition to identify universal laws for the organization of space by man. This positivist approach will long occupy a prominent place within geographic trends. Human geography was renewed at the end of the 1970s by Yves Lacoste, creator and founder of the review Hérodote in 1976 (first titled Strategies geographies ideologies, then in 1983 Revue de géographie et de géopolitique) and author of the essay La Geography is primarily used to wage war. He then rehabilitates a political approach to geography, a science which he believes can be used to serve the cause of the oppressed.</p>

<p>A certain part of geographers entirely reject physical geography by asserting geography as a social science, this vision is notably relayed in the journal Espace-Temps founded in 1975 by Jacques Lévy and Christian Grataloup</p>

<p>Today, geopolitics tends to analyze the consequences of globalization (geoeconomics) and the management of natural resources (gold; blue gold - water; black gold - oil; green gold - the forest) are the objects most studied by human geography. Human geography has also been enriched by a cultural approach (cultural geography studies the practices and lifestyles of populations. The geography of Gender, heir to postmodernism and a sub-branch of cultural geography has been developing in France since the end of from the 1990s.</p>
