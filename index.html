    <h1><a href="index.html">Geography</a></h1>
<p>Geography (from the Latin geographĭa, and this from the Greek γεωγραφία [geōgraphía], literally translated as "description of the earth") is the discipline that deals with the description or graphic representation of the Earth. In broad sense is the science that studies the earth's surface, the societies that inhabit it and the territories, landscapes, places or regions that form it when they relate to each other.</p>

<p>The first author to use the word geography was Eratosthenes (276-194 BC) in a work that is now lost. However, the founding of geography is attributed to the also considered father of history, Herodotus (484-420 BC). For the Greeks it is the rational description of the Earth and, particularly for Strabo, it is the study of the different human regions as the basis for the formation of the politician.</p>

<p>There are four historical traditions in geographic research, which are: spatial analysis of natural and human phenomena, studies of the territory (from place to region), study of the relationship between man and his environment, and research on Earth sciences.</p>

<p>Modern geography is a discipline whose primary objective is the explanation of a whole series of natural and social phenomena and does not refer only to the location of these phenomena, but also studies how they are and how they have changed to become what they are.</p>

<p>Geography is divided into two main branches: regional geography and general geography.</p>

<p>Regional geography studies the different subdivisions of terrestrial space in countries, states and regions at different scales of detail, from the geographic analysis of a small mountain valley, to the broad regional study of regions, countries, nations or states, and even, multinational spaces. While general geography is divided into two major branches: physical geography and human geography:</p>

    <p>Human geography deals with the study of people and their communities, cultures, economy and interactions with the environment by studying their relationships with and through space and place.</p>
    <p>Physical geography deals with the study of processes and patterns in the natural environment such as the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the geosphere.</p>

<p>The four historical traditions in geographic research are: spatial analysis of natural and human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relations, and Earth sciences. Geography has been called "the world discipline" and "the bridge between the human sciences and the physical sciences."</p>
