    <h1><a href="Astronomy.html">Astronomy</a></h1>
<p>Astronomy is the science of observing stars, seeking to explain their origin, their evolution, as well as their physical and chemical properties. With more than 5,000 years of history, the origins of astronomy go back beyond antiquity in prehistoric religious practices. Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs still play an active role. It is practiced as a hobby by a large audience of amateur astronomers.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Astronomical subjects</h2>

<p>At its beginning, during Antiquity, astronomy consisted mainly of astrometry, that is to say the measurement of the position in the sky of stars and planets.</p>

<p>Later, from the work of Kepler and Newton was born the celestial mechanics which allows the mathematical prediction of the movements of celestial bodies under the action of gravitation, in particular objects of the Solar System. Much of the work in these two disciplines (astrometry and celestial mechanics), previously done by hand, is now highly automated thanks to computers and CCD sensors, to the point that now they are seldom seen as separate disciplines. . From now on, the movement and position of objects can be quickly known, so much so that modern astronomy is much more concerned with observing and understanding the physical nature of celestial objects.</p>

<p>Since the twentieth century, professional astronomy has tended to separate into two disciplines: observational astronomy and theoretical astrophysics. Although most astronomers use both in their research, due to the different talents required, professional astronomers tend to specialize in one or the other of these areas. Observational astronomy is concerned primarily with the acquisition of data, which includes the construction and maintenance of instruments and the processing of results. Theoretical astrophysics is interested in researching the observational implications of different models, that is, it seeks to understand and predict the observed phenomena.</p>

<p>Astrophysics is the branch of astronomy which determines the physical phenomena deduced by the observation of the stars. Currently, all astronomers have extensive training in astrophysics and their observations are almost always studied in an astrophysical context. On the other hand, there are a certain number of researchers who exclusively study astrophysics. The work of astrophysicists is to analyze data from astronomical observations and to deduce physical phenomena from them.</p>

<p>The fields of study of astronomy are also classified into two other categories:</p>

    <p>by subject, generally according to the region of space (for example, galactic astronomy) or the type of problem dealt with (star formation, cosmology);</p>
    <p>by the mode of observation, according to the type of particles detected (light, neutrino) or their wavelength (radio, visible light, infrared).</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Disciplines by type of observation</h2>

<p>In astronomy, information mainly comes from the detection and analysis of visible light or another electromagnetic wave. Observational astronomy can be divided according to the observed regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the surface of the Earth, while others are only observable at high altitudes or even in space. Specific information on these sub-branches is given below.</p>

<h2 class="wb-stl-heading2">Amateur astronomy</h2>

<p>Amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects, using equipment that they sometimes build themselves. The most common targets for an amateur astronomer are the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor swarms, as well as deep sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. One branch of amateur astronomy is astrophotography, which involves photographing the night sky. Some amateurs like to specialize in observing a particular type of object.</p>

<p>Most amateurs observe the sky at visible wavelengths, but a minority work with radiation outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, or the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky who began observing the sky on radio waves in the 1930s. A number of hobbyists use either hand-made telescopes or telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but which are now open to them (for example the One-Mile Telescope).</p>

<p>A certain fringe of amateur astronomy continues to advance astronomy. In fact, it is one of the only sciences where amateurs can contribute significantly . They can perform the occultation calculations that are used to specify the orbits of the minor planets. They can also discover comets, make regular observations of double or multiple stars. Advances in digital technology have allowed enthusiasts to make impressive progress in the field of astrophotography.</p>
